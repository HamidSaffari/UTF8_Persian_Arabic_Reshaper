## 📖 About
An Arduino C Library fot Reconstructing Persian/Arabic sentences.

In languages like Persian/Arabic, the letter is modified depending on where it should go in a word. Usually, when you print to the display ordinary Persian/Arabic text, each character is printed individually and is not joined together, whereas a computer would join it automatically on the screen but not modifying the actual data of each character.

## 📚 Description
Persian/Arabic script is very special with two essential features:
- It is written from right to left.
- The characters change shape according to their surrounding characters.

So when you try to print text written in Persian/Arabic script on LCD/OLED display that doesn’t support Persian/Arabic you’re pretty likely to end up with something that looks like this:
