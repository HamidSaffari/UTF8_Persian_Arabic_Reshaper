## ðŸ“– About
Reconstruct Persian/Arabic sentences to be used in [u8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/). In languages like Persian/Arabic, the letter is modified depending on where it should go in a word. Usually, when you print to the display ordinary Persian/Arabic text, each character is printed individually and is not joined together, whereas a computer would join it automatically on the screen but not modifying the actual data of each character.

## ðŸ“š Description
Arabic script is very special with two essential features:
- It is written from right to left.
- The characters change shape according to their surrounding characters.

So when you try to print text written in Arabic script in an application â€“ or a library â€“ that doesnâ€™t support Persian/Arabic youâ€™re pretty likely to end up with something that looks like this:
