# u8g2-persian-reshaper
Reconstruct Persian/Arabic sentences to be used in [u8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/). In languages like Persian/Arabic, the letter is modified depending on where it should go in a word. Usually, when you print to the display ordinary Persian/Arabic text, each character is printed individually and is not joined together, whereas a computer would join it automatically on the screen but not modifying the actual data of each character.
